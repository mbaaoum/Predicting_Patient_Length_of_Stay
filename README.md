# Predicting_Patient_Length_of_Stay
Predicted patient Length of Stay in emergency departments using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Neural Networks). Identified key factors influencing LOS and provided insights to improve patient flow management, enhancing ED operational efficiency and patient care.

# Context:
Emergency departments (EDs) in the U.S. are grappling with overcrowding, which adversely impacts the quality, safety, and timeliness of patient care. The Patient Length of Stay (LOS) is a key performance metric, representing the time from a patient's arrival to discharge. Accurate prediction of LOS is essential for optimizing patient flow and reducing overcrowding, ultimately improving ED operations.

# Project Overview:
In this project, I utilized machine learning algorithms to predict patient Length of Stay (LOS) in emergency departments. I analyzed one year of patient records from a large academic medical center's ED and employed three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Neural Networks—to determine which model best predicts LOS. Additionally, I identified key factors contributing to extended patient stays and provided actionable insights to enhance patient flow management and operational efficiency in EDs. My work aimed to inform healthcare management strategies, potentially leading to improved patient care and better resource allocation.
